The BmiCalculator component is a React component designed to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input of height and weight. Here's a breakdown:

The component initializes state using useState hook to manage height, weight, BMI value, and status.

User input for height and weight is captured through input fields, and changes are handled by the Value function, updating the respective state values.

When the user clicks on the "Calculate" button, the bmiCalculator function is triggered:

It calculates the BMI using the formula: weight / (height * height), after converting height to meters.
Determines BMI status based on calculated BMI value.
Updates the state with the calculated BMI value and status.
There's also a "Clear" button that resets all input fields and results to their default values.

The component renders input fields for height and weight, along with buttons for calculation and clearing, and displays the calculated BMI value and status.

Overall, it provides a simple interface for users to calculate their BMI and see their BMI status instantly.
